Here's how the app can work, step-by-step, with this feature implemented:
How the App Works
1. User Roles and Login
Admin (Professor/TA):
Logs into the app and selects the class they are tracking.
Opens the live dashboard to monitor student participation during the session.
Students:
Log into the app before class starts.
Access their personal dashboard with a "Raise Hand" button to signal their intent to ask or answer a question.
2. Live Participation Tracking
For Students:
During class, if a student wants to ask or answer a question:
They click the "Raise Hand" button on their dashboard.
Their name dynamically appears on the professor/TA's live dashboard in real-time, signaling that they are participating.
Optionally, they can add a short note (e.g., "Question about topic X") when clicking the button.
For Admin (Professor/TA):
The professor/TA sees a live list of students who have clicked "Raise Hand."
For each student listed:
The TA can assign participation points (e.g., +1, +2) with a simple click.
Optionally, they can add notes or feedback for context (e.g., "Insightful answer about topic Y").
Once participation is logged, the student's name disappears from the live queue.
3. Post-Class Data Management
After class, all participation data is automatically saved in the database.
The professor/TA can review and edit participation logs if needed (e.g., adjust scores or add additional notes).
4. Student Access
Students can log into their dashboard anytime to:
View their total participation score for the semester.
See a timeline of their contributions with dates and feedback added by the professor/TA.
Technical Workflow
Frontend Workflow:
Students interact with a simple interface featuring a "Raise Hand" button.
Button triggers an event that sends their name and optional note to the backend.
Admins view a real-time list of participants on their dashboard.
Dashboard includes buttons to assign points and add notes dynamically.
Backend Workflow:
When a student clicks "Raise Hand," their request is sent to the backend via WebSocket or REST API.
The backend processes this request and updates the live queue for the professor/TA's dashboard.
Participation data is stored in the database after points are assigned.
Real-Time Updates:
Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or Firebase Realtime Database for instant updates between students and admin dashboards.
Example User Interface
Student Dashboard:
A clean interface with:
A prominent "Raise Hand" button.
Optional text field for adding context (e.g., "Question about topic X").
A summary section showing their total participation score and past contributions.
Admin Dashboard:
A live queue displaying:
Names of students who clicked "Raise Hand."
Buttons next to each name to assign points (+1, +2).
An optional text box for adding feedback or notes.
